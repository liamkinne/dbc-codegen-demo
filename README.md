# DBC Codegen Demo

This is a demonstration of generating a Rust API from a DBC file. This allows a single source of truth between telemetry software and firmware. It also enabled interoperability with J1939 without any knowledge of the protocol itself as the signals and identifiers a defined in the DBC file.

## Getting started
